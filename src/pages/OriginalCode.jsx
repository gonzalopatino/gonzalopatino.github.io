          This page contains links to the original, pre-enhancement versions of the thermostat 
          project components. These artifacts represent the baseline codebase used during the 
          code review process and serve as the foundation for all subsequent enhancements 
          documented in this ePortfolio.

            <p className="text-muted">
              The original thermostat was implemented as a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi. 
              It used a simple polling loop to read temperature data from a sensor, compare it against 
              a fixed setpoint, and control a GPIO pin to simulate heater activation. This monolithic 
              implementation served as the baseline artifact evaluated during the code review.

            <p className="text-muted">
              The control logic in the original project relied on direct threshold comparisons with 
              a basic hysteresis gap to reduce cycling. There was no formal state machine, no minimum 
              on/off timing enforcement, and no structured error handling. This reactive approach 
              represented the algorithmic baseline identified for enhancement.

            <a href="https://github.com/gonzalopatino/iot_thermostat_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original Data Handling and Logging Implementation</a>
            <p className="text-muted">
              The original system operated entirely in memory with no persistent storage or telemetry 
              capability. Temperature readings and system state were printed to the console but not 
              logged or transmitted. This lack of data persistence was a key limitation addressed 
              in the database enhancement.
